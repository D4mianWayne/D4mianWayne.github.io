This post will walk you through the recent CVEs reported to HPE Insight Remote Support by Anonymous user and disclosed through ZDI. This article will dive through multiple CVEs such as deserialization vulnerability, XSS and an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability which could not be exploited due to the setup issues but I have attached an incomplete PoC which can be used to exploit it and explained steps for further exploitation to achieve RCE.

# Overview

With the holiday vibes going around, I had no plans on releasing any posts but as I was working through this, I learned few things about secure coding practices and hunting for these reported vulnerabilities gives a good practice to understand the researcher's thought process and perhaps perform variant analysis in a similar situation. The Insight Remote Support application by HPE is used to gather information and statistics for multiple other hardwares such as printers and stuff, there are certain servlets exposed through web UI, accessible without authentication allowing exploitation of all the reported vulnerabilities much easier and with no dependency on credentials. A bit of background in regards with the software is that the web server is based on Tomcat server and perhaps you may have guessed by now the backend is developed on Java and this application also runs a service called DESTA on an unusual port which is also affected with one vulnerability we will be discussing.


# CVE-2024-53675 - XXE via ValidateAgainstXML

# CVE-2024-53673 - Insecure Deserialisation via DESTA Service

# CVE-2024-53676 - RCE via processAtatchmentDataStream
